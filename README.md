## CCTech June 2020 Data Science Internship Challenge

### Regression Problem (challenge 1)

You have been provided with two csv files:
- [dataset.csv](./resources/data_science/dataset.csv)
- [prediction.csv](./resources/data_science/prediction.csv)

Instructions to work on the regression problem:
- The dataset.csv file contains 9 features and 1 target column whereas the prediction.csv file contains just the features columns
- You are expected to train a ML model using the dataset.csv file and predict the target for the features of prediction.csv
- Add the predicted target column to the prediction.csv file with the column header "target"


### Classification Problem (challenge 2)

You have been provided with two csv files:
- [challenge2_dataset.csv](./resources/data_science/challenge2_dataset.csv)
- [challenge2_prediction.csv](./resources/data_science/challenge2_prediction.csv)


Instructions to work on the classification problem:
- The challenge2_dataset.csv file contains 3 features and 1 target column whereas the challenge2_prediction.csv file contains just the features columns
- You are expected to train a ML model using the challenge2_dataset.csv file and predict the target for the features of prediction.csv
- Add the predicted target column to the challenge2_prediction.csv file with the column header "Target"
